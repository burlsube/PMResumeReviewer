# PM Resume Reviewer

A Claude Code skill that runs a structured PM resume review using a simulated panel of three reviewers: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, and CPO.

Built for product managers targeting any level — APM through VP. The review adapts to whatever role and companies you're targeting. The reviewer criteria (outcomes vs. outputs, roadmap ownership, strategic scope) are PM-specific by design.

## What it does

- Gathers context: target role, target companies, and specific concerns
- Runs a three-lens panel review, each reviewer citing specific bullets and sections
- Produces a scorecard with scores and top concerns per reviewer
- Prioritizes the top 5 edits by impact with specific guidance on what to fix and why
- Offers to rewrite weak sections on the spot

The tone is direct. If something will get filtered before a human reads it, the skill says so.

## Who it's for

Product managers preparing for a job search, refreshing a stale resume, or targeting a specific level or company type. Especially useful before submitting to a role you actually want.

---

## Output structure

1. Three reviewer panels — Recruiter, Hiring Manager, CPO — each with specific citations
2. Per-reviewer scores and top concern
3. Overall scorecard
4. Top 5 prioritized edits (what's wrong, what to do, why it matters)
5. Offer to rewrite any section

## How to use it

Install via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Clone this repo and copy the folder into your skills directory:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cp -r PMResumeReviewer ~/.claude/skills/resume-review
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse PMResumeReviewer "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\resume-review"
```

Restart Claude Code. Then trigger with natural language — no slash commands needed:

- "Review my resume — I'm targeting Staff PM roles at AI companies"
- "Can you critique my PM resume?"
- "Is my resume strong enough for a Director of Product role?"
- "Help me improve my resume for fintech companies"
- Paste your resume and ask for feedback

## The reviewer lenses

- **Recruiter**: formatting, ATS keyword coverage, scannability, first-pass qualification signal
- **Hiring Manager**: outcomes vs. outputs, metrics quality, cross-functional evidence, strategic scope
- **CPO**: career narrative, scope progression, executive presence, AI depth (where relevant)

## Evals

The `evals/` folder contains three test cases with fictional resumes across different PM seniority levels and target roles — used for testing and iterating on skill behavior.
